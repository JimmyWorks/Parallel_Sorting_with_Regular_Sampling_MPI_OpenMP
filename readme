 Program Description
 This program uses the Parallel Sorting with Regular Sampling
 (PSRS) algorithm for parallel sorting using MPI and OpenMP.
 Sorting on a single process uses quicksort which is optimized
 using OpenMP.  The overall program is parallelized using MPI
 and multiple processors.  
 
 Program operation can be performed in one of three modes: 
 1 - NORMAL, 
 2 - DEBUG, and
 3 - TIMER.  
 
 NORMAL mode 
 Runs without any debug statements nor time statements except for
 the final reported run time.  
 
 DEBUG mode 
 Prints all debug statements and can only be done with the sample 
 count specified.  Sorting is verified by the parallel definition
 of sorted.
 
 TIMER mode
 Prints all the time intervals throughout the program
 allowing the program to be profiled for various bottlenecks.
 The program is timed based on the sorting tasks performed.

 NOTE: DEBUG mode also limits values to 0-29 for easy reading.
